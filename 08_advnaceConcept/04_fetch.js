// as we learn in asyncronus video {07_03}, fetch have their on queue which have higher priority , means if we have async function and fetch in program then in that case fetch get implement faster

// spectial queue for fetch is comonly known as microtask queue or priority queue

//if request able to send by program gets error as response then that response definetly take care by responce part
